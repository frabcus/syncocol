Syncocol
========

A proposed simple specification for syncing tabular data over HTTP via JSON transaction logs.


HTTP endpoint
-------------

Can be any URL, and is a GET request.

There are some extra URL parameters that a client can include:

* since - seq id to start at, returns everything after that, defaults to the start
* limit - maximum number of changes to return, defaults to unlimited XXX can a server optionally limit this to a maximum?
* include\_data - if present and false, the wire protocol's data field isn't included


Wire protocol
-------------

JSON representing part of the transaction log of changes to the tabular data.

<pre>
{ 
    seq: 10, 
    id: "07acde3002cb1f62a08de5469160b912", 
    deleted: false, 
    data: { first_name: "Ryan", last_name: "Pitts", employer: "The Spokesman-Review" } 
}
</pre>

* seq - the sequence in the transaction log
* id - unique identifier of the row
* deleted - if present and true, means the row is being deleted by the transaction
* data - new data for the row, should not be present if deleted is true (also see include\_data in the HTTP endpoint section)


Data format
-----------

**Keys** in the data dictionary can be any string, with any UTF-8 character, or
whitespace in them. To meet JSON specificaiton, they must be quoted if not 
simple like a variable name.

Note that as it is JSON, the keys can be in any order and change order.

**Values** in the data dictionary must be one of these types:

* Strings, in quotes
* Numbers, integers or floats
* Dates, a string containing an ISO 8601 date or date/time. Only in UTC no timezones.

Optional - by convention name variables storing WGS 84 latitude/longitude so
they end \_lat and \_lng. e.g. 
<pre>
    data: { city: "Liverpool", centre_lat: 53.4, centre_lng: -3 }
</pre>


Errors
------

Return error messages in a JSON dictionary with the key error, value an arbitary string.

<pre>
{
    error: "Datastore timed out"
}
</pre>


Todo
----

Make it use the right MUST type words from RFCs to be clear what is compulsory.
